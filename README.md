# money_and_inflation 
A project to learn and discover the causes and effect that the money supply has on inflation.  

About a month ago I had a dispute about what caused inflation with a superior, who is quite succesfull in the the financial planing world. He challenged my assumptions of inflation which primarly stem from Milton Freidman's propisition that inflation occurs when there is too much money chasing too few goods. The superior countered this view and pointed out there are many more factors post 21st century that affect inflation than money supply. This has continued to bother me, so I have decided to do some digging to find a possible answer. Unfortunately it seems I have found even more questions.
